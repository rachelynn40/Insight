# becquerel

Becquerel is a Python package for analyzing nuclear spectroscopic
measurements. The core functionalities are reading and writing different
spectrum file types, fitting spectral features, performing detector
calibrations, and interpreting measurement results. It includes tools for
plotting radiation spectra as well as convenient access to tabulated nuclear
data, and it will include fits of different spectral features. It relies
heavily on the standard scientific Python stack of numpy, scipy, matplotlib,
and pandas. It is intended to be general-purpose enough that it can be useful
to anyone from an undergraduate taking a laboratory course to the advanced
researcher.

## Installation

```
pip install becquerel
```

## Features in development (contributions welcome!)

* Reading additional `Spectrum` file types (N42, CHN, CSV)
* Writing `Spectrum` objects to various standard formats
* Fitting spectral features with Poisson likelihood

If you are interested in contributing or are want to install the package from
source, please see the instructions in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Reporting issues

When reporting issues with `becquerel`, please provide a minimum working example to help identify the problem and tag the issue as a `bug`.

## Feature requests

For a feature request, please create an issue and label it as a `new feature`.

## Dependencies

External dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and will be installed
automatically with the standard `pip` installation. They can also be installed
manually with the package manager of your choice (`pip`, `conda`, etc).
The dependencies `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml` and `html5lib` are necessary for
[`pandas`][1].

Developers require additional requirements which are listed in
`requirements-dev.txt`. We use [`pytest`][2] for unit testing and encourage
contributors to use [`pylint`][3], [`pycodestyle`][4], [`pydocstyle`][5] and
[`yapf`][6] for proper code formatting.
